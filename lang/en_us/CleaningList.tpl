	<h3>Welcome to Sky Mountain Camp!</h3>
	<p>Here are a few instructions to make your stay more comfortable.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
<li>Leave your shoes in the plastic shoe cabinet outside.</li>
<li>SMC talkabouts are available in the Bear Lodge for your use. Pls return them to their proper caddy when you depart from SMC.</li>
<li>Put away all personal bags on shelves inside the bedrooms and living room.</li>
<li>Please sleep in a sleeping bag and not directly on the sheet as we will NOT be laundering the linens after your stay.</li>
<li>Take an Advil before you sleep to help get adjusted to the high altitude as it typically takes 1-2 days.  The First Aid supplies are in the Bear Lodge Back room on the metal rack.</li>
<li>Please limit use of hair dryer/flat iron to ONE per lodge as our camp is on a generator for electricity.</li>
<li>Do not wander outside, esp. at night due to mountain animals. Always travel in groups or pairs.</li>
<li>If you need to re-fill any toilet paper or paper towel dispensers, the key is located in the house supply room closet on a lanyard.</li>
<li>Mini-flashlights are available at Bear Lodge if you need one.</li>
<li>When exiting your house, be sure to turn off all lights and faucets.</li>
<li>Report anything broken to Bryan Song @ bryansong@gmail.com (512)921-5916</li>
<li>Report any additional housing/cleaning supplies needed to Linda Kim â€“ linda.kim@gpmail.org</li>
<li>Upon final departure, please complete the CLEANING and EXIT checklists provided in the white binder.</li>
